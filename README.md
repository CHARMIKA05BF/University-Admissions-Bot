# 🎓 University Admissions Bot

## 📖 Overview

The **University Admissions Bot** is an intelligent assistant designed to simplify and streamline the college admissions process for students. Applying to universities can often be overwhelming due to complex program requirements, eligibility criteria, and multiple application guidelines. This project aims to make that journey easier by providing clear, concise, and well-structured guidance through an interactive chatbot system.
