🎓 University Admissions Bot
1. Introduction

In today’s digital world, students often face confusion and stress while applying to universities due to complex admission procedures, eligibility rules, and scattered information across multiple websites. Finding accurate and clear admission guidelines can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

The University Admissions Bot is designed as an intelligent assistant that simplifies this process by providing compressed, clear, and easy-to-understand information about program requirements and application guidelines. Instead of searching through multiple sources, students can directly interact with the bot and receive structured guidance in seconds.

This project focuses on improving accessibility, clarity, and efficiency in the university admission journey through a user-friendly chatbot interface.
